# ev-discharge---range-prediction
A machine learning-based framework for predicting electric vehicle (EV) battery discharge rate and estimating driving range using synthetic and real-world vehicle data. This project integrates performance metrics, battery parameters, and environmental conditions to build regression models using Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
